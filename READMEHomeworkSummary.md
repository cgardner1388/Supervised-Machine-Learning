# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

# Predicting the models

Before running the models, I feel like the random forest model will be the most accurate as the dataset has a lot of categorical data and consists of outliers. 

# Analyzing the results

After reviewing the results, the random forest test score is 63% which means that the model will be able to predict the credit risk of loans 63% of the time. As for the logistics regression model, the model will be 56% accurate which is lower than the random forest model. I even added in a solver "liblinear" to make it more accurate and it still is not as accurate as the random forest model. The random forest model is the model that should be used as it will be more accurate than the logistics regression model.
